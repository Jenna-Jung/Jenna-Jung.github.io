# CONCAT : combining data  

In this part we will be discuss about what `CONCAT` is and how to use this 
  
<br/>

# HOW TO USE

Let's say there's seperated columns with `first_name` and `last_name`.
If you want to have a full name column, `CONCAT` is the one that you need to use at this moment!

```sql
CONCAT(first_name, last_name)
```
However, if you use query like above, the result will be shown without any spaces, this will add more confusion. 
ex) JennaJung
    JuliaKim

Hence, you need to add space in between like below!

```sql
CONCAT(first_name, ' ' ,last_name)
```

by doing this, your result will be shown properly.
ex) Jenna Jung
    Julia Kim

If you want to make the result column with a new name simply add `AS` at the end of the query

```sql
CONCAT(first_name, ' ' ,last_name) AS 'full_name'
```
Dont forget to put '  ' for the new column name

See you :)
