# IN : 

`IN` is a command that you can use when certain required data should be included. 
  
<br/>

# NOT IN :

<br/> 
# HOW TO USE :

Before we get into the command, briefly check the data and columns

SELECT * FROM orders;

## IN
With `IN` command, you can filter the data like below.

```sql
SELECT order_priority, discount, customer_name, customer_region
FROM orders
WHERE customer_region IN ('Central', 'West');
```
-> this query only returns 'Central' or 'West' data from customer_region.
