# ORDER BY 

`ORDER BY`
Can be used when you want to sort results either in ascending or descending order.

We will use umart for this example
```sql
use umart;
```

# EXAMPLE #1 (ASC : ascending)
- Ascending is a default value, no need to write it down 

```sql
SELECT order_id, discount, unit_price, profit
FROM orders
ORDER BY profit;
```

# EXAMPLE #2 (DESC : descending)
- You should write DESC after the ORDER BY and value that you want to make an order

```sql
SELECT order_id, discount, unit_price, profit
FROM orders
ORDER BY profit DESC;
```

# Sort by manipulated columns / aliases ( Ï∂îÍ∞ÄÎ°ú ÎßåÎì† Ïª¨Îüº Î™Ö )
- You can use aliases to create an order for the data, see below example

```sql
SELECT order_id, discount, unit_price, profit*2 AS Double_profit
FROM orders
ORDER BY Double_profit DESC;
```

You can use `ORDER BY` with newly made column too.

# Sort by multiple columns
- You can sort multiple columns using `ORDER BY`.

```sql
SELECT order_id, discount, unit_price, profit
FROM orders
ORDER BY profit DESC, discount;
```

As you can see from the result, <br/>
profit is in descending order, and discount is in ascending order.<br/>
* by using ,(comma) you can sort by multiple columns.<br/>

# NULL
- NULL value is treated as lowest value, <br/> therefore, if you search data that includes NULL value, you should keep that in mind.
ex) if you use `DESC` with the data that has `NULL` in it, <br/>
the result will shown `NULL` at the bottom


ex) if you use `ASC` with the data that has `NULL` in it,  <br/>
the result will shown `NULL` at the top
