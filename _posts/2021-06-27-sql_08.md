# AND: 

`AND` : all conditions must be met

<br/> 
# OR: 

`OR` : at least one condition must be met

# HOW TO USE :

Let's use data from `umart` as an example data <br/>
 
### AND

Below query search data where order_priority = 'High' `AND` ship_mode = 'Regular Air' <br/>
-> the results only show data that order_priority is 'High' and ship_mode is 'Regular Air

```sql
SELECT order_priority, discount, shipping_cost, ship_mode, discount
FROM orders
WHERE order_priority = 'High' AND ship_mode = 'Regular Air';
```

### OR

Below query search data where order_priority = 'High' `OR` ship_mode = 'Regular Air' <br/>
-> the results only show data that order_priority is 'High' or ship_mode is 'Regular Air

```sql
SELECT order_priority, discount, shipping_cost, ship_mode, discount
FROM orders
WHERE order_priority = 'High' OR ship_mode = 'Regular Air';
```

- As you can easily see the difference between `AND` and `OR` operator

### examples

We've learned `BETWEEN`, `IN / NOT IN`, and today `AND/OR` <br/>
Lets see some combined examples !

- You can use AND and IN/NOT IN like below <br/>
```sql
SELECT order_id, customer_id, customer_region, customer_country, customer_segment 
FROM orders
WHERE customer_segment IN ('Small Business','Corporate')
AND   customer_region NOT IN ('North', 'South');
```

- You can use BETWEEN and AND ike below <br/>
```sql
SELECT order_id, discount, unit_price, profit
FROM orders
WHERE profit BETWEEN 100 AND 200
	AND discount NOT BETWEEN 0.1 AND 0.5;
```

üê∂ NOTE üê∂

- `WHERE` operator only appear once
- `AND` is performed before `OR`, just like multiplication is performed before addition. <br/>
  (think of AND is like ( x, / ) and OR as ( -, + )
- After the `AND/OR` operator, sepcify the "FULL CONDITION" <br/>
  (ex, rental_duration = 3 OR 6 -> X)<br/>
  (ex, rental_duration = 3 OR rental_duration = 6 -> O)
  
  
## bracket 
You can use `bracket` in order to perform the operator as you want,<br/> 
We will use `sakila` for this examples.
```sql
USE sakila;
```
In case, you want to use `OR` query before AND in case of below situation, you can use brackets

```sql
SELECT film_id, title, rental_duration, rental_rate, rating
 FROM film
 WHERE (rental_duration =7 OR rental_duration=3)
 AND rating="G";
```
The result shows the 7 or 3 rental_duration with rating 'G'

To clarify the concept will show example without `bracket`

```sql
SELECT film_id, title, rental_duration, rental_rate, rating
 FROM film
 WHERE rental_duration =7 OR rental_duration=3
 AND rating="G";
```
