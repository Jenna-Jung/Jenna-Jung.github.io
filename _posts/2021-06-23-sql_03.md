# WHERE : 

In this part we will be discuss about what `WHERE` command is and how to use it
  
<br/>

# HOW TO USE :

Let's say there's retail company data 
Refer below image,

![png](_posts/sql_where.png){: width="80%" height="80%"}  


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT course_subject
FROM courses;
```
The result will be shown only unique course_subject data

Also, the distinct command can be made with two columns.
Below is the display of the distinct combination of values in course_subject and course_level columns

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT course_subject, course_level 
FROM courses;
```
The results only return unique data of combination of course_subject and course_level !

In this part we have discussed `DISTINCT` command, 
`DISTINCT` command can be used to understand how all those data looks like at the begining of the data analysis stage. 

Cant wait to use this commands with real data ! keep an eye on next postings
see you at the next section! bye
