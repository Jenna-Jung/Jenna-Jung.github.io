# WHERE : 

In this part we will be discuss about what `WHERE` command is and how to use it
  
<br/>

# HOW TO USE :

Let's say there's retail company data called umart
Before we get into the command, briefly check the data and columns

```sql
USE umart;
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

With `WHERE` command, we can get selected data by using operators ( < , > , = , != , >= , <= )
This operator works well with int, and str data type
see below examples how it can be used 

```sql
SELECT row_id, discount, unit_price, customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 3;
```
-> this query only returns customer_id 3 data.

```sql
SELECT order_id, shipping_cost, customer_name
FROM orders
WHERE customer_name = 'Jenna';
```
-> this query only returns data when the customer_name is 'Jenna'

### date 
with `WHERE` we can use date using operators. 
see below example

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date, customer_region, customer_country 
FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2012/01/01';
```
the result returns before '2012/01/01' dates


see you at the next section! bye
