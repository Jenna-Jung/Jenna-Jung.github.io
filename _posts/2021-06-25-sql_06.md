# LIKE : 

`LIKE` is an operator helps us to search patterns instead of an exact value.

<br/> 
# HOW TO USE :

Let's use data from `umart` as an example data <br/>
 
### % (percentage sign)

this % (percentage sign) represents any sequence of charactor<br/>
see below example<br/>
below example will search any data starts with 'E' (+ any number afterwords)<br/>
* no matter how many charactor, as long as the first letter starts with 'E'<br/>

```sql
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM orders
WHERE customer_name LIKE 'E%';
```

*** If you want to search the name that has 'E' inside of thier name, put % before and after,<br/>
like below ` %E%`

```sql
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM orders
WHERE customer_name LIKE '%E%';
```
As you can see the result we get all the name that has `E` in the name.

- side note If you want to search specific words in the data, put space before and after the word.<br/>
`'% the %'` -> like this.<br/>
this will find you data that has 'the' in it.<br/>

### _ (underscore)

This underscore helps you to find more specific requirements, like below,<br/>
if you do `'_r'`<br/>
one _(underscore) stands for one letter,<br/>
hence, this means go and get all the data which has 'r' in the second letter. <br/>

Also, if you do `'__r'` <- two underscores, 
= go & get r in thier third letter!

üê∂ NOTE #1 üê∂

`LIKE` is also worked with numbers(int) <br/>
ex) 
```sql
WHERE Lifeexpectancy LIKE '%.0';
```

üê∂ NOTE #2 üê∂

You can use this with `NOT` <br/>
ex)
```sql
WHERE customer_name NOT LIKE 'a%';
```
üê∂ NOTE #3 üê∂

By using `LIKE`, you can find data, that is more than two words <br/>
ex) `'% %'`
```sql
WHERE customer_name LIKE '% %';
```

See you at the next section! Bye
