# BETWEEN : 

`BETWEEN` is an operator helps us retrieve records that are between two values.

<br/> 
# HOW TO USE :

Let's use data from `sakila`  - film  <br/>
Before we get into the command, briefly check the data and columns

```sql
USE sakila;
SELECT * FROM film;
```

Now lets see some examples to understand how it works
<br/>

### First example (int)
```sql
SELECT film_id, title, length
FROM film 
WHERE length BETWEEN 60 AND 90;
```
<img width="217" alt="int" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75202769/123130814-0f2a4000-d488-11eb-827e-f46879780171.png">
The result shows the length between 60 and 90.
<br/>
As you probably recognized, the films that are 60 minutes long and 90 minutes are all included, 
and this is because the between operator is "inclusive"

### Second example (text/str)

```sql
SELECT film_id, title, length 
FROM film
WHERE title BETWEEN 'A' and 'D';
```
<img width="232" alt="str" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75202769/123131507-b7400900-d488-11eb-8576-fd8bf95f70e5.png">
<br/>

Now with string values, we get all the films where the title isbetween 'A' and 'D'.
(all the titles start with either A, B and C)

### Third example (date)

```sql
SELECT * FROM sakila.rental
WHERE DATE(rental_date) BETWEEN '2005-05-24' AND '2005-05-26';
```
<img width="598" alt="date" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75202769/123132289-8d3b1680-d489-11eb-86d9-548d92c3fb4c.png">

The result shows records where the rental date is either 24, 25 or 26. <br/>
* small tip : if you put DATE with () like upper example query, you can disregard time data and only get dates 


### Fourth example (NOT)

`BETWEEN` command can be use with `NOT`
<br/>
For instance, you can get films that is not 60~90 length

```sql
SELECT film_id, title, length
FROM film 
WHERE length NOT BETWEEN 60 AND 90;
```
the result will be shown with the film that are longer than 90 or shorter than 60 like below 
<br/>
<img width="207" alt="NOT" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75202769/123133468-b7d99f00-d48a-11eb-9e20-68fe14237180.png">

üê∂ NOTE üê∂

`BETWEEN` should be used created like below <br/>

```sql
BETWEEN lower_threshold AND upper_threshold
```
