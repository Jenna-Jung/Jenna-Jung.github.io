# DISTINCT : 

In this part we will be discuss about what `DISTINCT` command is and how to use it
  
<br/>

# HOW TO USE

Let's say there's online course lecture data, there will be same subject name, lecturer and more. 
It would be easier for the data analyst to remove all duplicated data

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT course_subject
FROM courses;
```
The result will be shown only unique course_subject data

Also, the distinct command can be made with two columns.
Below is the display of the distinct combination of values in course_subject and course_level columns

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT course_subject, course_level 
FROM courses;
```
The results only return unique data of combination of course_subject and course_level !

In this part we have discussed `DISTINCT` command, 
`DISTINCT` command can be used to understand how all those data looks like at the begining of the data analysis stage. 

Cant wait to use this commands with real data ! keep an eye on next postings
see you at the next section! bye
